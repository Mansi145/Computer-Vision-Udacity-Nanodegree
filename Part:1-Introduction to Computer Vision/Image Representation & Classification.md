### Cognitive and Emotional Intelligence
**Cognitive intelligence** is the ability to reason and understand the world based on observations and facts. It's often what is measured on academic tests and what's measured to calculate a person's IQ.

**Emotional intelligence** is the ability to understand and influence human emotion. For example, observing that someone looks sad based on their facial expression, body language, and what you know about them - then acting to comfort them or asking them if they want to talk, etc. For humans, this kind of intelligence allows us to form meaningful connections and build a trustworthy network of friends and family. It's also often thought of as only a human quality and is not yet a part of traditional AI systems.
